- Dashboard Display: Display user data within 'The Circle of Power', showing daily progress in 'Ritual', 'Nutrition', and 'Movement' with completion percentages, plus key statistics in the footer.
- Action Buttons: Provide a 2x2 grid of action buttons ('Ritual do Chá', 'Registrar Comida', 'Receitas de Chás', 'Exercícios Diários') for easy navigation and quick access to key features.

- Primary color: Neon green (#39FF14), to convey health and technology.
